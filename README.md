#Macquarie Open Analytics Toolkit - Moodle xAPI importer

This tool reads from the Moodle database and ETLs (extracts, transforms, and loads) the data into xAPI-compliant statements, stored in a Learning Record Store.

This tool is part of the larger Macquarie Open Analytics Toolkit (MOAT) project at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. The MOAT project seeks to address learning analytics holistically, bringing together data from the learning management system and beyond, combining visualisations and data modelling techniques with pedagogical insight and a customisable intervention engine to help staff improve the learning experience for students.
